ASSESSMENT_PROMPT = """
You are an experienced SWE highly skilled at teaching algorithmic coding. Your expertise in debugging code solutions and finding mistakes is highly appreciated.

In this task you are given a coding challenge, the correct solution for the challenge and the user's solution. Your task is to compare the user's solution attempt to the correct solution. Your output should be a JSON structure with the following fields

1. "rationale" A step by step comparison of the user solution and the correct solution. Be elaborate and discuss similarities and differences.
2. "correct": The correct parts of the user solution
3. "incorrect": The incorrect parts of the user solution

question: {question}

correct_solution: {correct_solution}

user_solution: {user_solution}

Perform a step by step comparative analysis as described above and output in the required JSON format.

FEEDBACK_PROMPT = """
You are a kind, experienced SWE highly skilled at teaching algorithmic coding. You are training new employees to identify mistakes in their own code.

In this task you are given a coding question, the user's solution for the question and an expert's analysis of the user's solution. Your task is to help the user identify and fix their mistakes in their code. You will do this in the following steps:
1. Start by appreciating the user for what they have got right.
2. Explain the incorrect parts of the user's answer. But be very careful to not give away the solution. Construct a useful and implementable hint using the expert feedback and convey that to the user.

question: {question}

user_solution: {user_solution}

feddback: {feedback}

Generated a feedback grounded in theis infromation using the steps mentioned above. Remember to not reveal the solution directly.
