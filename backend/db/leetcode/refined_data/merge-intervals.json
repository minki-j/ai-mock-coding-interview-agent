Then, to determine which connected component each node is in, we perform graph traversals from arbitrary unvisited nodes until all nodes have been visited. To do this efficiently, we store visited nodes in a `Set`, allowing for constant time containment checks and insertion. Finally, we consider each connected component, merging all of its intervals by constructing a new `Interval` with `start` equal to the minimum start among them and `end` equal to the maximum end.\n\nThis algorithm is correct simply because it is basically the brute force solution. We compare every interval to every other interval, so we know exactly which intervals overlap. The reason for the connected component search is that two intervals may not directly overlap, but might overlap indirectly via a third interval. See the example below to see this more clearly.\n\n![Components Example](../Figures/56/component.png)\n\nAlthough (1, 5) and (6, 10) do not directly overlap, either would overlap with the other if first merged with (4, 7). There are two connected components, so if we merge their nodes, we expect to get the following two merged intervals:\n\n(1, 10), (15, 20)\n\n\n<iframe src=\"\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def overlap(self, a, b):\n        return a[0] <= b[1] and b[0] <= a[1]\n\n    # generate graph where there is an undirected edge between intervals u\n    # and v iff u and v overlap.\n    def buildGraph(self, intervals):\n        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n        for i, interval_i in enumerate(intervals):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(intervals)):\n                if self.overlap(interval_i, intervals[j]):\n                    graph[tuple(interval_i)].append(intervals[j])\n                    graph[tuple(intervals[j])].append(interval_i)\n\n        return graph\n\n    # merges all of the nodes in this connected component into one interval.\n    def mergeNodes(self, nodes):\n        min_start = min(node[0] for node in nodes)\n        max_end = max(node[1] for node in nodes)\n        return [min_start, max_end]\n\n    # gets the connected components of the interval overlap graph.\n    def getComponents(self, graph, intervals):\n        visited = set()\n        comp_number = 0\n        nodes_in_comp = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\n        def markComponentDFS(start):\n            stack = [start]\n            while stack:\n                node = tuple(stack.pop())\n                if node not in visited:\n                    visited.add(node)\n                    nodes_in_comp[comp_number].append(node)\n                    stack.extend(graph[node])\n\n        # mark all nodes in the same connected component with the same integer.\n        for interval in intervals:\n            if tuple(interval) not in visited:\n                markComponentDFS(interval)\n                comp_number += 1\n\n        return nodes_in_comp, comp_number\n\n    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        graph = self.buildGraph(intervals)\n        nodes_in_comp, number_of_comps = self.getComponents(graph, intervals)\n\n        # all intervals in each connected component must be merged.\n        return [\n            self.mergeNodes(nodes_in_comp[comp])\n            for comp in range(number_of_comps)\n        ]\n```\n\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" name=\"VH5daGtY\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time complexity : $$O(n^2)$$\n\n    Building the graph costs $$O(V + E) = O(V) + O(E) = O(n) + O(n^2) = O(n^2)$$ time, as in the worst case all intervals are mutually overlapping. Traversing the graph has the same cost (although it might appear higher at first) because our `visited` set guarantees that each node will be visited exactly once. Finally, because each node is part of exactly one component, the merge step costs $$O(V) = O(n)$$ time. This all adds up as follows:\n\n    $$\n        O(n^2) + O(n^2) + O(n) = O(n^2)\n    $$\n\n* Space complexity : $$O(n^2)$$\n\n    As previously mentioned, in the worst case, all intervals are mutually overlapping, so there will be an edge for every pair of intervals. Therefore, the memory footprint is quadratic in the input size.\n\n<br/>\n\n---\n\n### Approach 2: Sorting\n\n**Intuition**\n\nIf we sort the intervals by their `start` value, then each set of intervals that can be merged will appear as a contiguous \"run\" in the sorted list.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nFirst, we sort the list as described. Then, we insert the first interval into our `merged` list and continue considering each interval in turn as follows: If the current interval begins *after* the previous interval ends, then they do not overlap and we can append the current interval to `merged`. Otherwise, they do overlap, and we merge them by updating the `end` of the previous interval if it is less than the `end` of the current interval.\n\nA simple proof by contradiction shows that this algorithm always produces the correct answer. First, suppose that the algorithm at some point fails to merge two intervals that should be merged. This would imply that there exists some triple of indices $$i$$, $$j$$, and $$k$$ in a list of intervals $$\\text{ints}$$ such that $$i < j < k$$ and ($$\\text{ints[i]}$$, $$\\text{ints[k]}$$) can be merged, but neither ($$\\text{ints[i]}$$, $$\\text{ints[j]}$$) nor ($$\\text{ints[j]}$$, $$\\text{ints[k]}$$) can be merged. From this scenario follow several inequalities:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{ints[i].end} < \\text{ints[j].start} \\\\\n    \\text{ints[j].end} < \\text{ints[k].start} \\\\\n    \\text{ints[i].end} \\geq \\text{ints[k].start} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe can chain these inequalities (along with the following inequality, implied by the well-formedness of the intervals: $$\\text{ints[j].start} \\leq \\text{ints[j].end}$$) to demonstrate a contradiction:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n    \\text{ints[i].end} < \\text{ints[j].start} \\leq \\text{ints[j].end} < \\text{ints[k].start} \\\\\n    \\text{ints[i].end} \\geq \\text{ints[k].start}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, all mergeable intervals must occur in a contiguous run of the sorted list.\n\n![Sorting Example](../Figures/56/sort.png)\n\n\nConsider the example above, where the intervals are sorted, and then all mergeable intervals form contiguous blocks.\n\n<iframe src=\"\n```python3\nclass Solution:\n    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n\n        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n        merged = []\n        for interval in intervals:\n            # if the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current\n            # interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.\n            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:\n                merged.append(interval)\n            else:\n                # otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous\n                # intervals.\n                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])\n\n        return merged\n```\n\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" name=\"95HUcjnF\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time complexity : $$O(n\\log{}n)$$\n\n    Other than the `sort` invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the list, so the runtime is dominated by the $$O(n\\log{}n)$$ complexity of sorting.\n\n* Space complexity : $$O(\\log N)$$ (or $$O(n)$$)\n\n    If we can sort `intervals` in place, we do not need more than constant additional space, although the sorting itself takes $$O(\\log n)$$ space. Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of `intervals` and sort that."
