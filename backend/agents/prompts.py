Great job on the thought process! Now, let’s dive into coding:
1. Use the code editor to start implementing your ideas.
2. Feel free to adjust your plan, but let me know here if you do.
3. You can ask for feedback at any stage—I’ll provide tips without giving away the full solution.
4. If you need any clarification, just ask.
Alright, let’s start coding!
