- Shows difficulty in analyzing runtime complexity or provides inaccurate assessments, even for simpler components of the solution.

Borderline
- Proposes only a basic or brute-force solution without considering optimizations or suggests ineffective optimization strategies.
- Exhibits gaps in knowledge of common data structures and algorithms or struggles to implement them effectively in code.
- Can accurately analyze the runtime of straightforward solutions but faces challenges with more intricate ones.

Solid
- Makes an effort to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen data structures and algorithms, even if the analysis is not entirely accurate.
- Successfully implements a basic solution and proposes valid optimizations, though complete implementation may be lacking.
- Demonstrates a working knowledge of common data structures and algorithms.
